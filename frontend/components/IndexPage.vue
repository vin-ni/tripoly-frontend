        We want to create a decentralized board-game on Tezos, toeducate people
        about renewable and sustainable projects ina playful and interactive
        way. We want to disrupt the game idea of Monopoly and turn itsvalues
        around, from capitalism and re-shape it for the futureof web3 to an open
        source knowledge game using theconventions and the features of the
        metaverse.
        <br />
        For this game, named Tripoly , we forget the bank, the loans,and the
        race to become rich #capitalism. We revisit theMonopoly's mechanism, we
        take inspiration from it to makethe project funny and interactive. Some
        of you may think about this other game : Anti-Monopoly. Let's say that
        Tripoly is the NFT's sibling of theAnti.
